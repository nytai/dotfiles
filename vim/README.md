## Shortcuts

`<Leader>` is defined as the `\` key by default. `C-x` means Control + x and `M-x` means Meta-x. (*alt* or *option* in modern keyboards) `S-x` means Shift-x.

* `<Leader>y`: Copy to system clipboard
* `<Leader>d`: Cut to system clipboard
* `<Leader>p`: Paste below, from system clipboard
* `<Leader>P`: Paste above, from system clipboard
* `<F5><F5>`: Toggle paste mode. (Not important if you're using the shortcuts above.)
* `<F5>`: Reload Vim settings
* `<Leader>n`: New empty tab.
* `<Space>x`: Remove search highlight.
* `<Leader>]`: Open/Close NERDTree
* `<Leader>[` : Navigate between split views
* `<Tab>`: Buffer list (Normal Mode)
* `C-p`: Fuzzy finder
* ``<Leader>` ``: Swap the positions of the open splits
* `<Space>w`: Next sub-word in a camel cased word
* `<Space>b`: Previous sub-word in a camel cased word
* `<Space>e`: End of sub-word in a camel cased word
* `C-n`: Add the next occurrence of the selection to the multiple cursor selection

Other functions should work as expected. You can define key mappings for your own usage by editing the file `~/.vim/vimrc`, and you are certainly encouraged to do so. That's how you can get the most out of Vim.

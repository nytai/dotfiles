# Tai's Dotfiles
These are some of the files I need to make the magic happen.


## Installation
    gem install bundler
    git clone git://github.com/nytai/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    bundle install
    thor dotfiles:install

## Inspiration
These files are an amalgamation of configs, copy+pasted, from various corners or the inter-webs. Repo structure and general template inspired by [sferik/dotfiles](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles)
